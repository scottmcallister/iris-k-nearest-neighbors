# iris-k-nearest-neighbors

A machine learning project to classify Iris flowers into separate species based on petal and sepal measurements using [K Nearest Neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm). This project was used as a classification problem example in the book [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://www.amazon.ca/Introduction-Machine-Learning-Python-Scientists/dp/1449369413).

### Installing

Before running this script, you'll need install the required packages in your virtual environment from `requirements.txt`. First, create a virtual environment and activate it if you haven't already.
